# Advanced Website Stress Testing Script

This Python script is designed for stress testing your website by sending high-concurrency requests. It allows you to test your server's load-handling capacity and performance under heavy traffic. The script is compatible with **Termux** and supports both `GET` and `POST` requests.

---

## **Features**
- Supports both `GET` and `POST` request types.
- Allows **randomized URL paths** and headers to simulate real user behavior.
- Customizable concurrency and request numbers for flexible load testing.
- **Thread pooling** for efficient resource usage.
- Lightweight and optimized for Termux and other Linux-based environments.

---

## **Requirements**
To use this script in Termux, ensure you have the following installed:
1. **Python** (version 3.x or later)
2. Python library **requests**

### Install Required Packages
Run the following commands in Termux to install the required packages:
```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade
pkg install python
pip install requests
```

---

## **How to Use**
Follow the steps below to run the script:

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository containing the script:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
cd <repository-name>
```

### 2. Run the Script
Run the script using Python:
```bash
python ddos.py
```

### 3. Provide Inputs
When the script runs, it will ask for the following inputs:
1. **Target Website URL:**  
   Enter the URL of the website you want to test (e.g., `https://example.com`).
2. **Total Number of Requests:**  
   Enter the total number of HTTP requests to be sent (e.g., `10000`).
3. **Number of Concurrent Threads:**  
   Specify the number of threads for sending requests (e.g., `500`).
4. **Request Type:**  
   Enter `GET` or `POST` based on your test requirements.
5. **POST Data (Optional):**  
   If using `POST`, provide a key-value pair for the payload.

#### Example Input
```plaintext
Enter the target website URL (with https://): https://example.com
Enter the total number of requests: 10000
Enter the number of concurrent threads: 500
Enter the request type (GET/POST): POST
Enter POST data key: username
Enter POST data value: admin
```

---

## **Expected Output**
The script will display the status of each request sent to the target website. Example:
```plaintext
Request to https://example.com/login sent: 200
Request to https://example.com/api/data sent: 404
Request to https://example.com/products sent: 200
Error for https://example.com/random-page: ReadTimeout
```

At the end, the script will show the total time taken to complete the test.

---

## **Commands Summary**
Hereâ€™s a quick reference for all necessary commands:

1. Update Termux and install Python:
   ```bash
   pkg update && pkg upgrade
   pkg install python
   pip install requests
   ```

2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
   cd ddos.py
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ddos.py
   ```

## **Important Notes**
1. **Ethical Usage Only:**  
   - Use this script **only for testing your own website** or with proper authorization.  
   - Unauthorized usage on third-party websites can lead to legal issues.

2. **Server Monitoring:**  
   - Ensure your server's resources (CPU, RAM, bandwidth) can handle the stress test.  
   - For AWS-hosted websites, be aware of security features like rate-limiting and auto-scaling.

3. **Testing Environment:**  
   - It is recommended to run this script on a staging environment to avoid affecting production servers.

---

## **Troubleshooting**
If the script doesn't work as expected:
1. Verify the Python version installed:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
2. Ensure the `requests` library is installed:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```
3. Check the URL and parameters you are entering during input.
